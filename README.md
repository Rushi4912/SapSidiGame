# About The Game
The Snake and Ladder Game is a classic board game that brings together excitement, luck, and strategy. This digital adaptation of the traditional game offers a fun and engaging experience for players of all ages.

# Objectives
Reach the Final Square: The primary objective of the game is for each player to move their game piece from the starting square to the final square on the game board. The first player to do so is declared the winner.

Navigate the Board: Players must strategically roll the dice and make calculated moves to navigate the game board efficiently. Planning your moves to avoid snakes and make use of ladders is crucial to reaching the final square faster.

Use Luck and Strategy: The game combines luck (rolling the dice) and strategy (choosing the best moves) to create an engaging experience. Players must balance their decisions based on the dice roll and the positions of snakes and ladders.

Climb Ladders: Landing on the base of a ladder allows a player to advance several spaces ahead, thus providing a shortcut to higher positions on the board. Utilizing these ladders strategically can give players a significant advantage.

Avoid Snakes: Players need to be cautious and avoid landing on the head of a snake. Landing on a snake's head will force the player to slide back to a lower position on the board, setting back their progress.
